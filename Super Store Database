#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices.

#Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price.
SELECT * FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;

#Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price descending.
SELECT * FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc;

#Use a SELECT statement to get stock quantities for each category.
SELECT SUM(stock_quantity), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

#Use a SELECT statement to get average stock quantities for each category.
SELECT AVG(stock_quantity), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

#Use a SELECT statement to get the minimum average rating for each category.
SELECT MIN(average_rating), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

#Use a SELECT statement to get the maximum price in each category.
SELECT MAX(price), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

#Use a SELECT statement to get all kitchen supplies.
SELECT * FROM superstore
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies';

#Use a SELECT statement to count all item IDs with a price greater than or equal to 30$.
SELECT COUNT(item_id)
FROM superstore
WHERE price >=30;

#Use a SELECT statement to get a count of all distinct items with a price greater than or equal to 30$.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT price)
FROM superstore
WHERE price>=30;

#Use a SELECT statement to order items with a quantity over 50 with an average rating less than or equal to 4.3.
SELECT * FROM superstore
WHERE stock_quantity>50 && average_rating<=4.3;

#Use a SELECT statement to order items with an average rating greater than or equal to 4.5.
SELECT * FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating>4.5;
